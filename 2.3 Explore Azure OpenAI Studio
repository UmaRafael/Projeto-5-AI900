You can deploy, manage, and explore models in your Azure OpenAI Service by using Azure OpenAI Studio.

1. On the Overview page for your Azure OpenAI resource, use the Explore button to open Azure OpenAI Studio in a new browser tab. Alternatively, navigate to Azure OpenAI Studio directly.

2. View the pages available in the pane on the left. You can always return to the home page at the top. Additionally, OpenAI Studio provides multiple pages where you can:
   Experiment with models in a playground.
   Manage model deployments and data.
