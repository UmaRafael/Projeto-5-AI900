1. Type in a prompt: "What are 3 pros and cons of traveling in the winter?". You will see a Searching for:… and Generating… appear before the response. The model uses the searched for responses as grounding information to generate original responses. Notice that the end of the response contains links to its sources.

2.Type in a prompt: "Find me 3 more pros." What you mean with this prompt is that you would like to see 3 more positive reasons for traveling in the winter that have not already been listed. Notice that with this prompt, you are asking Copilot to do two things that search alone does not do: use the previous chat response to exclude what’s returned in the new response, and use the previous chat’s topic without explicitly stating it.

3. Type in a prompt: 'Where are 3 places I can go to find fewer crowds?."

4. The New Topic button next to the chat window is useful. Clicking it clears the previous conversation thread so your new topic responses are not based on the previous topic. Use the New Topic icon next to the chat window to clear your message history.
